My wasm learning repo.  
Might help you with some info about wasm.  
Try it yourself~  
Run `./main` to compile 


## Tools
compile tool:  ( .c .cc ) to .wasm
assume you are using ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install emscripten`

.wasm runtime on linux 
`curl https://wasmtime.dev/install.sh -sSf | bash`

.wasm to .txt  human_readable assembly file , a litle bit like `objdump` 
`sudo apt-get install wabt` 
simple usage : `wasm-objdump -x factorial.wasm > dump.txt`
more like `objdump` : `wasm2wat` (this tool included in wabt)

## wasm instruction set compare to riscv instruction set(take for a traditonal ISA example)
Assume you know some basic concepts about traditional ISA:

(below generate by BingAI)
key differences: 
1. Instruction Set:
Wasm: Uses a stack-based execution model. Instructions operate on an implicit stack, and there are no explicit registers.
RISC-V: Uses a register-based execution model. Instructions operate on explicit registers like addi (add immediate) and sp (stack pointer).
2. Registers:
Wasm: Does not have registers like traditional ISAs. Instead, it uses a stack to manage values.
RISC-V: Has a set of registers, including general-purpose registers and special-purpose registers like the stack pointer (sp).
3. Instruction Format:
Wasm: Instructions are designed to be compact and are encoded in a binary format. For example, i32.const pushes a 32-bit integer onto the stack.
RISC-V: Instructions are typically fixed-length and operate on registers. For example, addi adds an immediate value to a register.
4. Execution Model:
Wasm: Uses a virtual machine to execute instructions. It is designed to be platform-independent and can run in various environments, including browsers.
RISC-V: Instructions are executed directly by the hardware.


Hereâ€™s a brief comparison using your example:

Wasm:
(local.get 0)
(i32.const 1)
(i32.gt_u)

RISC-V:
Assembly

addi t0, t0, 1
